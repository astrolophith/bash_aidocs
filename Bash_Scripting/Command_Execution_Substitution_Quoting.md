# Command Execution: Substitution Quoting

## Details
Quoting

The double quotes in `[[ "$(Expression)" -ne 0 ]]` are crucial for several reasons, primarily to prevent issues related to:

1.  **Word Splitting:**
    * If the output of `$(Expression)` contains spaces or other whitespace characters (which is unlikely in this specific case, but good practice to follow), Bash would perform word splitting on the result.
    * Word splitting breaks the result into separate words, which can lead to unexpected behavior in the `[[ ]]` test.
    * Double quotes prevent word splitting, ensuring that the entire output of `$(Expression)` is treated as a single string.

2.  **Globbing (Filename Expansion):**
    * If the output of `$(Expression)` contains wildcard characters like `*`, `?`, or `[ ]`, Bash would perform filename expansion (globbing).
    * Globbing replaces the wildcard characters with matching filenames, which can also lead to unexpected behavior.
    * Double quotes prevent globbing, ensuring that the wildcard characters are treated literally.

3.  **Empty or Missing Output:**
    * If for some reason `$(Expression)` produces no output, without double quotes, the `[[ ]]` test would become `[[ -ne 0 ]]`, which is a syntax error.
    * With double quotes, it becomes `[[ "" -ne 0 ]]`, which is a valid comparison (though it would evaluate to true). This prevents a syntax error.

**In the specific case of `$(Expression)`, the output is a single numeric value, so word splitting and globbing are not a concern.**

**However, it's a very good and safe habit to always double-quote command substitutions and variable expansions within `[[ ]]` tests.**

**Why this is good practice:**

* **Robustness:** Your scripts will be more resilient to unexpected input or changes in the output of commands.
* **Consistency:** It's easier to remember to always double-quote than to try to figure out when it's necessary.
* **Clarity:** It makes your code more readable and easier to understand, as it explicitly indicates that you're treating the output as a single string.
